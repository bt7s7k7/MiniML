# MiniML

Minimal, spec-noncompliant markdown parser and renderer. Allows for rendering into HTML, Vue components and LaTeX.

Features:

  - Faculties for parsing and rendering are fully separated, the intermediate representation can be serialized to JSON
  - Allow for creating widgets that act as scriptable macros for use in your code
  - Partial support for ingesting raw HTML code, currently tested for parsing Google Docs files
  - Fully featured command line interface
  - Allows usage as a Vite plugin, allowing you to load `.md` files
